# SLfRank: Shinnar-Le-Roux Pulse Design with Reduced Energy and Accurate Phase Profiles using Rank Factorization

This repo contains code for the SLfRank pulse design algorithm.

The code depends on SigPy and CVXPy.
You can install dependent libraries by running

     pip install -r requirements.txt

To get stared, see `demo.ipynb`.
